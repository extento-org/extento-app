# Enterprise Support Packages

> Reach out at extento.dev@gmail.com to discuss the following packages:

 ## *Two-Four Week Sprint Contract*
 
 We pair you with one of our Extento consultants to get your organization set up, train employees and developers, brainstorm internal use cases, and possibly build out your first layer.
 
 ## *Ongoing Weekly Tech Support*
 
 We commit to a once a week meetup session to help work through any issues you encounter when using Extento.
 
 ## *Custom Library Development*
 
 If you have an idea for a features not included in Extento but that don't make sense for us to include in our public repos, don't fret. Let's discuss a timeline and contract to build out what you need.

## CRITIQUEME.md (45 minutes)

It's day one of the sprint and you've got a ticket that depends on a codebase you're not familiar with. You pull up the readme but you find little of value. Let's add a UI to make it easier to add improvement suggestions to a repo's readme and then store those suggestions in your bookmarks where you can later reference them when you're not stressed.

This workspace will run in the background and auto copy "git clone \<repo\>" for whatever repo you are viewing the browser.

## To Mic or Mute (15 minutes)

Detects whether or not the user has a connected bluetooth mic and mutes the sound if they don't. Prevent yourself from being *that* guy at the coworking space.

## Kudos Keeper (1 hour)

So you're looking at the comment section of a jira ticket and thinking, damn, what a great explanation my colleague provided. With this workspace you can right click anywhere on the page and save the reference to their awesome work. The kudos will be saved to your bookmarks with the link and their name.

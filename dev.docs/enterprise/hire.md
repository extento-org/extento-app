# Enterprise Support Packages

> Reach out at extento.dev@gmail.com to discuss the following support packages:

 ## *Two Week Sprint Contract*

 We pair you with one of our Extento consultants to get your organization set up, train employees and developers, brainstorm internal use cases, and possibly build out your first workspace.

 ## *Ongoing Weekly Tech Support*

 We commit to a once a week meetup session to help with any issues you encounter when using Extento.

 ## *Custom Library Development*

 If you have an idea for a feature or features not included in Extento but that don't make sense for us to include in our public repos, don't fret. Let's discuss a timeline and contract to build out what you need.

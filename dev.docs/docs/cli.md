# Extento CLI

 > An NPM package to scaffold new Extento projects and workspaces.

 :warning: *Always use **npx** unless you really know what you're doing.*

 ## Create

 This command will download and modify the [extento-app](https://github.com/extento-org/extento-app) repo under the hood to set up your new project. 

 ```bash
 > npx @extento/cli create my_app
 > cd my_app
 > npm i
 > npm run start
 ```

 ## Workspace

 Must be run inside of an existing Extento project. It will download more code from the [extento-app](https://github.com/extento-org/extento-app) repo and prepare some files for you to write your application logic inside of.

 :warning: *If you're getting strange compile errors after using this command, try restarting webpack*

 ```bash
 > npx @extento/cli workspace my_workspace
 > npm run start
 ```

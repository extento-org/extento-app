# Styles

 ## TailwindCSS

 Extento uses TailwindCSS out of the box. Wherever you are able to write React code you will be able to use tailwind's built-in utility classes. For further customization there are 3 files available inside of src/styles: **plugins.js**, **theme-extension.js**, **theme.css**. These files make it possible to manage tailwind plugins, theme extensions, and custom stylesheets for a more custom look. 

 Don't want to use tailwind? Just avoid those utility classes and don't modify any files in src/styles.

 :warning: Support for other styling libraries will not be a part of Extento V1. Extento is run by a single developer at the moment.
